# Problem Statement

## Background
Aline is a technical thought leader marketing her new book *Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview*. She wants to leave helpful Reddit comments using our tool.

## Current Situation
- Our AI generates great personal comments (e.g., ADHD founder)
- However, it's weak on technical ones (e.g., Options trader)
- Risk: We could lose important customers like Aline if we don't improve

## Technical Details
- Tool currently pulls from user's knowledgebase to generate comments
- Need to import Aline's technical knowledge into knowledgebase:
  - Blogs
  - Guides  
  - Book content
