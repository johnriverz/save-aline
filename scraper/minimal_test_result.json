      "content": "Years ago, Steve Krug wrote a book about web design called Don\u2019t Make Me Think. It\u2019s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them.\n\nResumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn\u2019t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less. We've said before that spending a lot of time on your resume is a fool's errand, but if you\u2019re going to do something to it, let\u2019s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Here's exactly what to do.\n\nA lot of other platforms offer resume reviews or help with writing resumes for $$. We don't do it, despite a lot of our users asking for this feature. The reason I've refused to build them is because, simply put, resume writing is snake oil. Why? Because recruiters aren't reading resumes. If you don't have top brands, better wording won't help. If you do have top brands, the wording doesn't matter.\n\nAt interviewing.io, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of thousands of engineers go through job searches, and the biggest mistakes we see people make are all variations on the same theme: not postponing their interview when they aren\u2019t ready. In most situations, there is no downside to postponing. In this post, we'll tell you what to do and say.\n\nNine free chapters of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview are now available for free. You can find them here.\n\nThey include: Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Mike Mroczka, and Nil Mamano, and I have written the official sequel to Cracking the Coding Interview (often called the bible of technical interview prep). The sequel is fittingly called Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview.\n\nWe cover everything you need to know for today's tougher technical interviews and hiring climate. We have (at least) thirteen new technical topics and over 150 new problems. We\u2019ve also drawn on a decade of hiring data and 100k interviews from interviewing.io to help you get noticed, manage your job search, and negotiate the best possible offer.\n\nThe book is available now, and purchases come with $50 off on interviewing.io... given that it costs ~$45, it's not a bad deal.\n\nI\u2019m the founder of interviewing.io, and in some ways, I\u2019m the meritocracy hipster who was writing about how eng hiring should be meritocratic and about how quotas are bad, way before saying either was cool. At interviewing.io, my team and I have been trying to make hiring meritocratic for the last decade.\n\nI\u2019ll also be the first to admit that DEI is ideologically flawed because of its emphasis on race and gender-based outcomes and its insistence on equality of those outcomes. In the last decade, we've seen a lot of bad stuff done in the name of DEI, firsthand. I'll talk about those in this post.\n\nBut all the recent pro-meritocracy, anti-DEI rhetoric is bad. Yelling \u201cMeritocracy!\u201d as if it\u2019s a fait accompli is just as harmful as the worst parts of DEI. I\u2019d even go so far to say that the DEI movement has done more for meritocracy than the loud pro-meritocracy movement is doing right now.\n\nI\u2019m delighted that \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is no longer a dirty word. But, just saying it isn\u2019t enough. We have to change our hiring practices. We need to stop using meritocracy as a shield to preserve the status quo.\n\nIn this post, I talk about the flaws of DEI, the false promise of meritocracy, and what to do to actually make hiring meritocratic and fair.\n\nHave you ever wondered if you should spend more time on LeetCode, participate in those contests, or focus on solving harder problems? A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll share what we\u2019ve learned.\n\nIn part 1 of this post, we analyzed different ways to get into companies along two axes: effectiveness and how much control you actually have.\n\nThe channel that maximizes both effectiveness and control is cold outreach to hiring managers (not recruiters!). And yet, most people do this type of outreach incorrectly. In this post, we'll tell you exactly what to do and what to say to reach out to hiring managers at top companies and get responses.\n\ninterviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform \u2014 we help engineers prepare for technical interviews. In this market, many of our users are struggling with getting in the door at companies, so we ran a survey to see what\u2019s worked well and what hasn\u2019t, in today\u2019s difficult climate.\n\nNot surprisingly, warm referrals are the best way in. On the other hand, agency recruiters are clearly the worst. But not all channels are created equal. Some, like recruiters contacting you, you have minimal control over, and whether you get contacted is largely a function of whether you have top brands on your resume or belong to an underrepresented group. With others, like reaching out to hiring managers, you are fully in control of your destiny. Here's how to make the most of a difficult landscape.\n\nWe surveyed almost 700 of our users about their experiences with take-homes and interviewed a handful more for deeper insights. We learned a lot\u2014mostly about candidates' poor experiences and negative feelings toward take-homes. They take a lot of time. They don\u2019t respect candidates\u2019 time. Candidates often get no feedback. And candidates are almost never compensated. Really, it's all about value asymmetry.\n\nThe good news? Turns out there are some pretty simple things companies can do to vastly improve their take-home assignments.\n\nInterview prep and job hunting are chaos and pain. We can help. Really.",
