Save Aline Assignment

Hey I’m Maddie. Here’s the quick take home assignment.

I’ll be reviewing submissions.

For the best submission, we will start immediately. 

Note: A lot of people end up writing scrapers that only work for Aline - custom code that’ll never be reused. It’s a trap. The best folks realize the goal is to build something reusable that can scale to any future customer.


Problem: 

Aline is a technical thought leader marketing her new book Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. She wants to leave helpful Reddit comments using our tool.

Our AI generates great personal comments (eg: ADHD founder). But it's weak on technical ones (eg: Options trader)

If we can’t fix this, we’ll lose important customers like Aline.

Right now, our tool pulls from a user’s knowledgebase to generate comments.

To help Aline, we need to import her technical knowledge (blogs, guides, and book)  into that knowledgebase.

Your Task:

Build a scraper that pulls content into our knowledgebase format.

Sources to scrape:
Every blog post on interviewing.io: https://interviewing.io/blog
Every company guide here: https://interviewing.io/topics#companies 
Every interview guide here: https://interviewing.io/learn#interview-guides
All of Nil's DS&A blog posts: https://nilmamano.com/blog/category/dsa
First 8 chapters of her book (PDF) Google Drive Link
Make it work for any blog (eg: https://quill.co/blog) 

Requirements:
Solve the core problem (importing technical knowledge)
Make it scalable for future customers
Don’t make custom code for each source! 
End-to-end delivery — keep the customer experience in mind

Scoring
No rules. Vibe code. Use repos, APIs, whatever works.
You’ll be scored on:
How robust your implementation is (e.g. does it work on https://quill.co/blog?)
How well you understand what you're building
Your thinking process - why you built it the way you did


Input Examples:
Blog URL (e.g. https://interviewing.io/blog)
PDF upload (e.g. Aline’s book)


Expected Output:
{
  "team_id": "aline123",
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Item Title",
      "content": "Markdown content",
      "content_type": "blog|podcast_transcript|call_transcript|linkedin_post|reddit_comment|book|other",
      "source_url": "optional-url",
      "author": "",
      "user_id": ""
    }
  ]
}
